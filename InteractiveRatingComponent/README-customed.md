## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript (interactive)
- Flexbox
- CSS @media 
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to do media queries with breakpoint between mobile and desktop size by using CSS @media rule from W3Schools.com. Also media queries will work better at bottom of css file. You don't have to write all elements for each breakpoint. In other words, we only need to change its size like margin and padding.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp) - This helped me remind to how to do media queries.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.css-tricks.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand flexbox and display. It have various of guides related to css. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
