## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

- Practice with layout design
- Try to learn how to set various text stuff like line-height, font-size with CSS or html tags
- Need help to find the information about how to adjust from desktop to mobile size.

### Useful resources
